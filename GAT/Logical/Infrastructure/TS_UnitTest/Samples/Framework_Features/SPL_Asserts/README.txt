Please note


The samples in this program provides no good programming style! 
They are solely for demonstrating the behavior of the framework.
Bad style: 
	o	There is no test of any function or FB, just asserts failing or passing (depending on PV values)
	o	Expectations are variables and no constants
	o	Mulitple asserts per Test Case
