Please note


The samples in this program provides no good programming style! 
They are solely for demonstrating the behavior of the framework.
Bad style: 
	o	Asserts should only be used to verify the test case as the report should be short ans meaningful (No explainings, just the relevant facts). 
	o	Asserts should only be used in test cases. 
	o	Test cases should be named meaningful.
	o	Macros are used instead of helper functions.
